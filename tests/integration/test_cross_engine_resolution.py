"""Cross-engine consistency checks for resolution function width conventions.

The same model + resolution function should produce broadly the same
reflectivity on refnx and refl1d.  A width-convention error at one engine
boundary shows up as a systematic disagreement between them.

.. warning::

   These are **smoke tests, not the regression tests for issue #367.**  They
   compare the engines against each other, so they are blind to any error
   applied consistently to both, and -- measured, not assumed -- they are only
   sensitive enough to catch *one* of the two bugs #367 fixed:

   * ``LinearSpline``: the pre-fix refl1d code **over**-smeared by 2.355x,
     which moves the curve enough to be caught here (measured separation ~2x).
   * ``Pointwise``: the pre-fix refnx code **under**-smeared by 2.355x from an
     already-small width.  That barely moves the curve -- measured separation
     ~1.1x, against a baseline engine disagreement of the same size -- so **no
     tolerance can catch it here.**  The Pointwise test below is a consistency
     check only.

   The actual, exact regression tests for both conventions live in
   ``tests/calculators/test_resolution_conventions.py``, which intercepts the
   widths handed to each backend and asserts them to floating-point precision.
   Fix that file first if these ever conflict.

.. note::

   Reflectivity spans several decades and the engines' different resolution
   algorithms (refnx: pointwise convolution; refl1d: oversampling) disagree
   most at fringe minima, where R is tiny and *relative* differences explode.
   The comparison is therefore made on ``log10(R)``, and the tolerances are
   measured values with roughly 1.5x headroom rather than round numbers.
