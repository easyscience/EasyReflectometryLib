# GitHub Copilot Instructions for EasyReflectometryLib

## Project Overview

EasyReflectometryLib is a reflectometry Python package built on the EasyScience framework. It provides tools for reflectometry analysis and modeling.

## Development Environment

- **Python Versions**: 3.11, 3.12
- **Supported Platforms**: Linux (ubuntu-latest), macOS (macos-latest), Windows (windows-latest)
- **Package Manager**: pip
- **Build System**: hatchling with setuptools-git-versioning

## Code Style and Formatting

### Ruff Configuration
- Use **Ruff** for linting and formatting (configured in `pyproject.toml`)
- Maximum line length: 127 characters
- Quote style: single quotes for strings
- Import style: force single-line imports
- To fix issues automatically: `python -m ruff . --fix`

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write clear, self-documenting code with meaningful variable names
- Maintain consistency with existing code patterns in the repository

### Linting Rules
The project uses Ruff with the following rule sets:
- `E9`, `F63`, `F7`, `F82`: Critical flake8 rules
- `E`: pycodestyle errors
- `F`: Pyflakes
- `I`: isort (import sorting)
- `S`: flake8-bandit (security checks)

Special notes:
- Asserts are allowed in test files (`*test_*.py`)
- Init module imports are ignored
- Exclude `docs` directory from linting

## Testing

### Test Framework
- Use **pytest** for all tests
- Test coverage should be tracked with **pytest-cov**
- Aim for comprehensive test coverage
- Tests are located in the `tests/` directory

### Running Tests
```bash
# Install dev dependencies
pip install -e '.[dev]'

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov --cov-report=xml

# Run tests using tox (for multiple Python versions)
pip install tox tox-gh-actions
tox
```

### Test Guidelines
- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Include tests when fixing bugs to prevent regression
- Test files should match the pattern `test_*.py`
- Use descriptive test function names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the existing test structure and patterns in the repository

## Security

- Follow flake8-bandit security guidelines (enabled via Ruff `S` rules)
- Be cautious with user input and file operations
- Do not commit secrets or sensitive information
- Review security implications of all changes

## Documentation

### Docstring Style
- Include docstrings for all public modules, classes, and functions
- Use **Sphinx/reStructuredText style** docstrings (`:param`, `:type`, `:return`, `:rtype`)
- Use clear, concise descriptions
- Document parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Example format:
  ```python
  """
  Brief description of the function.

  :param param_name: description of parameter
  :type param_name: type
  :return: description of return value
  :rtype: return_type
  """
  ```

### Documentation Build
- Documentation is built using Sphinx (version 8.1.3)
- Source files are in the `docs/` directory
- Use myst_parser (MyST parser) for Markdown support
- Include code examples in documentation where appropriate

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- easyscience (EasyScience framework)
- scipp (Scientific computing)
- refnx, refl1d (Reflectometry calculations)
- orsopy (Data format support)
- bumps (Optimization)

### Adding New Dependencies
- Only add dependencies when absolutely necessary
- Add to appropriate section in `pyproject.toml`:
  - `dependencies` for core runtime dependencies
  - `dev` for development tools
  - `docs` for documentation building
- Document why the dependency is needed

## Git and Version Control

### Commit Messages
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

### Branch Workflow
- Create feature branches from the main branch
- Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-new-calculator`, `bugfix/fix-reflection-calculation`)
- Keep changes focused and atomic

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Include tests for new functionality
2. Update documentation if adding or changing features
3. Ensure all CI checks pass:
   - Code consistency (Ruff)
   - Code testing (pytest on all supported platforms/versions)
   - Package building
4. Code should work on Python 3.11, 3.12 and all supported platforms
5. Write a clear PR description explaining the changes

```

## Best Practices

1. **Minimal Changes**: Make the smallest possible changes to accomplish the task
2. **Don't Break Existing Code**: Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly required
3. **Test Before Committing**: Always run tests and linting before pushing
4. **Follow Existing Patterns**: Look at similar code in the repository for guidance
5. **Ask When Uncertain**: If unsure about an approach, ask for clarification

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:
- **Code Consistency**: Runs Ruff linting on all pushes and PRs
- **Code Testing**: Runs pytest across multiple Python versions and platforms
- **Package Testing**: Validates package building and installation
- **Coverage**: Uploads test coverage to Codecov

All CI checks must pass before merging PRs.

## Special Notes

- The project is part of the EasyScience ecosystem
- Built on top of established reflectometry libraries (refnx, refl1d)
- Focuses on providing a user-friendly interface for reflectometry analysis
- Maintains compatibility with multiple calculator backends
